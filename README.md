📈 Stock Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict future stock prices based on historical market data. The goal is to build a model that can forecast stock trends and closing prices using techniques like Linear Regression, LSTM, or other deep learning models.


## 🧠 Overview

Stock market prediction is a challenging problem due to its non-linear, dynamic, and noisy nature. This project explores multiple approaches to model stock price movements using data-driven techniques.  
We use time-series analysis and machine learning to predict the closing price of a given stock.
